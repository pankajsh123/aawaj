# aawaj
Aawaj is porject in which we made a glove which can recognise hand gestures and than convert them to voice 
For recognising gestures flex sensors , contact sensors , accelerometer and gyroscope are implanted on a glove which gives bent of fingers and orientation of hand . We used SVM model from scikit-learn to train our machine .
